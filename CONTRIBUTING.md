# Contributing Guide (English)

## Communication
- Discuss significant changes in GitHub issues before opening a pull request.
- Use English for issue titles and summaries; add Korean context when helpful.

## Development Workflow
1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch: git checkout -b feature/your-change.
2. Keep branches focused—one logical change per pull request.
3. Follow the coding conventions used in each package (Prettier/ESLint for frontend, Ruff/Black style for Python).

## Testing
- Backend: add or update pytest coverage and run pytest before submitting.
- Collector & Dashboard: run 
pm run build and lint scripts to verify TypeScript correctness.
- Containers: execute docker compose up --build to ensure multi-stage images build successfully.

## Commit & PR Standards
- Write descriptive commit messages using the imperative mood (e.g., Add event batching helper).
- Provide bilingual (English + Korean) descriptions in pull requests when user-facing behaviour changes.
- Include screenshots or logs for UI or infrastructure modifications where relevant.

**Frontend:** Preact (TypeScript)

**Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.11+)

These conventions are designed to ensure **maintainability and consistency** across the project.

### 📥 Python (FastAPI) Convention

✅ **Naming Rules**

| Item | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Variable | `snake_case` |
| Function | `snake_case` |
| Class | `PascalCase` |
| Constant | `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES` |
| Filename | Lowercase, words separated by `_` |
| Module/Package | Lowercase letters, numbers, and `_` only |

✅ **FastAPI Architecture**

| Layer | Role |

| `core` | Manage global **shared components** (settings, configuration, utilities) |
| `features` | The top-level directory for individual **functional domains** (e.g., `ingest`, `analysis`) |
| `router` | Define FastAPI **endpoints** (request/response mapping) |
| `service` | Handle **business logic** and validation |
| `repo` | Manage **data access** (InfluxDB read/write operations) |
| `schemas` | Define **data models** (Pydantic Request/Response models) |

✅ **Security & Management**

- Store sensitive information in `.env` (via `python-dotenv` or `pydantic.BaseSettings`)
- Use `-reload` option in `uvicorn` **only during development**
- Manage logs using the `logging` module or `structlog`
- Use static analysis tools such as `ruff`, `sonarlint`, and `bandit` for code quality and security

### 📢 General Rules

- Split commits into **small, meaningful units**
- One commit = one logical change
- PR titles must follow the same **convention as commit messages**

## Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Tests cover the new behaviour and edge cases.
- [ ] Configuration changes include documentation updates.
- [ ] Security-sensitive code paths were reviewed for input validation.
- [ ] Docker image size impact considered for new dependencies.

## Conduct
- Be respectful, collaborate openly, and welcome new contributors.
- Report abusive behaviour to the maintainers via the security contact channel.
